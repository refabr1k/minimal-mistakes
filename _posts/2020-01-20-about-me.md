# Hello! 

I wrote this blog to share knowledge and help beginners (like me) to get a head start in pentesting/hacking/bugbounty! 

Just less than 1 year ago (at point of this writing) I __did not__ know anything about hacking/pentesting. All I had was just an interest to break into a job role in the 'cybersecurity realm' from a drag-my-feet-to-work kind of job. I later learnt that hacking (legally) is something called 'penetration testing' and really loved the idea of hacking that can help companies become more secure (ethical hacking).

I later deep-dived into learning to become a penetration tester and *bug bounty hunter* and hope to share whatever I can with anyone who is interested to become one too.
